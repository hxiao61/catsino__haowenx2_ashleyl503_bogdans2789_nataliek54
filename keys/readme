1. Deck of Cards API
API that does the following:
- Create a new shuffled deck
- Draw cards
- Reshuffle deck
- Create piles

This is the basis for our card games including blackjack, poker, maybe some additional stretch goals in the future

2. The Cat API
Uses:
- 10k+ cat images with metadata and breeds
- Breed information, categories, facts

This is how we are going to pull images for decorations and the theme of our site, cats.

3. Evil Insults Generator API
Small API that generates "evil" insults
We know it has super duper bad words.
We will use it when the player loses
